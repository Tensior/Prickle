# Mr. Prickle

This is my personal project, in which I tried to create game from scratch in one of my favourite genres - 2d platformer. 

Game development is my passion and I've been creating this game in my spare time. It is great to dive deep into new world and become its creator, trying myself not only as a programmer but also as a game designer, artist, etc.

Main menu and one gameplay level are already done and it is completely playable, so you can try it out. But the project is still in progress and I plan on adding new levels, save system, multiple difficulties and overall improvement of Mr. Prickle.

Hope you will enjoy my game!
